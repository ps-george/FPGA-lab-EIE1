#Multiplication

###Task

Multiplication is a form of repeated addition, and while there are some multiplier blocks built into the FPGA, it is useful to know how they are constructed. The notion of pipelining is also an important concept for your project - how can we (and why do we) split one operation across multiple consecutive cycles?
