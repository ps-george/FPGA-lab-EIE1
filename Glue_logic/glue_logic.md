#Glue Logic

###Task

One of the uses of an FPGA is as [glue logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_logic),
where it effectively acts as a convenient way of connecting
together lights. The DE0 contains 10 lights and 10 switches,
so "glue" the switches to the lights - when you toggle each
switch the corresponding LED should turn off and on.
