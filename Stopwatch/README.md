##Stopwatch

###Task

The DE0 contains a 4-digit 7-segment output display,
with each segment driven by one output pin. Create
a project and top-level called "stopwatch" that has
the following functionality:

- Push-button BUTTON0 resets the stopwatch,
  resetting the 7-segment display to "00.00".

- Push-button BUTTON1 starts the stopwatch,
  showing elapsed time in decimal, with two
  fractional digits, i.e. a precision of 10 ms.

- Push-button BUTTON2 pauses the display for as
  long as it is pushed (held down), but does not stop
  the stopwatch counter, providing something similar to the
  [split](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopwatch) functionality
  of a stopwatch. Here the split time always reflects the time
  between when the "start" and "split" button are presses,
  not the time between consecutive presses of "split".
